- 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin. I formerly worked on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) at Meta (Facebook) AI. 
- 🚀 I co-founded [Hegel AI](https://hegel-ai.com/). We are building developer tools for LLMs. Check out [`prompttools`](https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools) and drop us a ⭐.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, distributed systems, and economics/finance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about LLMs and thinking about how we can use them to make positive impacts in the world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and hear about your pain points building with LLMs
- 📫 How to reach me: Open a PR in this repo - https://github.com/NivekT/NivekT/ or email kevin (at) hegel-ai.com
