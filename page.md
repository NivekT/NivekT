Hi NivekT,  

    I'm an undergraduate student sincerely hoping to do some contributions to machine learning projects like PyTorch.  
    But the structure of PyTorch and other projects are very complex, an object may have a relationship with lots of other objects in other files,
    I often get lost after opening several files and tear hair out all day trying to figure out the meaning of some functions.  
    I never meet such a big project and don't know how to start.  
    So could you give me some advice about how to become a contributor to an open source project?  

    Please forgive my poor English >_<
